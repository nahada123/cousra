<h3 text-align="left"><b>HISTORY of HTML</b></h3>
<p2><ol>
<li> In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, who was a contractor at CERN, proposed and
prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.</li><br>
<li> In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.</li><br>
<li> Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.</li><br>
<li> The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",
first mentioned on the Internet by Berners-Lee in late 1991.</li><br>
<li> In the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification was released</li>
<li> Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial
software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</li><br>
<li> In 2004 development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology
Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008,
and completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.</li><br>
